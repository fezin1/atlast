    "statement": "Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that $p(0) = 1$ and $p(1) = 1$. Show that $p(n)$ is odd for all integers $n$.",
    "solution": "Consider the polynomial modulo 2. Since $p(0) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ and $p(1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, the polynomial $p(x) \\pmod{2}$ takes the value 1 at both 0 and 1.\r\n\r\nOver $\\mathbb{F}\\_2$, any polynomial that takes the value 1 at both points must be identically 1. Therefore, $p(x) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ for all integers $x$, which means $p(n)$ is odd for all integers $n$.\r\n\r\n**Key Insight:** Working modulo 2 simplifies the problem significantly by focusing on the parity of the polynomial values.\r\n\r\n## Alternative Approach\r\n\r\nLet $q(x) = p(x) - 1$. Then $q(0) = 0$ and $q(1) = 0$, so $x(x-1)$ divides $q(x)$. Thus $p(x) = 1 + x(x-1)r(x)$ for some polynomial $r(x)$ with integer coefficients. For any integer $n$, $n(n-1)$ is even, so $p(n) = 1 + \\text{even number} = \\text{odd}$."

Show that if $n$ is square-free and for every prime $p$ dividing $n$, we have $(p-1)$ divides $(n-1)$, then $n$ satisfies the condition.\r\n\r\n2. Verify that primes satisfy this condition.\r\n\r\n3.
