    "statement": "Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that $p(0) = 1$ and $p(1) = 1$. Show that $p(n)$ is odd for all integers $n$.",
    "solution": "Consider the polynomial modulo 2. Since $p(0) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ and $p(1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, the polynomial $p(x) \\pmod{2}$ takes the value 1 at both 0 and 1.\n\nOver $\\mathbb{F}\\_2$, any polynomial that takes the value 1 at both points must be identically 1. Therefore, $p(x) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ for all integers $x$, which means $p(n)$ is odd for all integers $n$.\n\n**Key Insight:** Working modulo 2 simplifies the problem significantly by focusing on the parity of the polynomial values.\n\n## Alternative Approach\n\nLet $q(x) = p(x) - 1$. Then $q(0) = 0$ and $q(1) = 0$, so $x(x-1)$ divides $q(x)$. Thus $p(x) = 1 + x(x-1)r(x)$ for some polynomial $r(x)$ with integer coefficients. For any integer $n$, $n(n-1)$ is even, so $p(n) = 1 + \\text{even number} = \\text{odd}$."

Show that if $n$ is square-free and for every prime $p$ dividing $n$, we have $(p-1)$ divides $(n-1)$, then $n$ satisfies the condition.\n\n2. Verify that primes satisfy this condition.\n\n3.

    "solution": "Approach\n\n### Step 1: Find $f(0)$\nSet $x = y = 0$:\n$$f(0) = f(0) + f(0) + 0 \\Rightarrow f(0) = 0$$\n\n### Step 2: Assume polynomial form\nSince the equation involves $2xy$, try a quadratic function. Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\n### Step 3: Substitute into the equation\nLeft side: $f(x+y) = a(x+y)^2 + b(x+y) + c$\nRight side: $f(x) + f(y) + 2xy = (ax^2 + bx + c) + (ay^2 + by + c) + 2xy$\n\n### Step 4: Compare coefficients\nEquating both sides:\n$$a(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + b(x + y) + c = a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c + 2xy$$\n\nThis gives:\n$$2axy + c = 2xy + 2c$$\n\nSo: $2a = 2$ and $c = 2c$, thus $a = 1$ and $c = 0$.\n\n### Step 5: Final solution\n$f(x) = x^2 + bx$ for any real $b$. However, check if this satisfies the original equation:\n\n$$f(x+y) = (x+y)^2 + b(x+y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + bx + by$$\n$$f(x) + f(y) + 2xy = (x^2 + bx) + (y^2 + by) + 2xy = x^2 + y^2 + bx + by + 2xy$$\n\nThese are equal, so $f(x) = x^2 + bx$ works for any $b$.\n\n### Step 6: Check if there are other solutions\nOne can show that these are the only solutions using standard functional equation techniques.\n\n## Final Answer\nThe functions are $f(x) = x^2 + bx$ for any real constant $b$.\n\n## Submission\n\nSubmit your solution by **October 1, 2025** using the Google Form link above. Include your complete proof and any interesting observations.\n\n## Discussion Points\n\n1. Are there any other types of functions that might satisfy this equation?\n2.
