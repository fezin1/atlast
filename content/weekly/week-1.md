## Problem Statement

Find all functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that for all real numbers $x, y$:
$$f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + 2xy$$

## Hints

1. **Start with special cases:** Try setting $y = 0$ and see what you get.
2. **Look for polynomial solutions:** What degree polynomial might satisfy this?
3. **Consider derivatives:** If you assume differentiability, what can you deduce?
4. **Check specific values:** Test small integer values to guess the pattern.

## Solution Approach

### Step 1: Find $f(0)$
Set $x = y = 0$:
$$f(0) = f(0) + f(0) + 0 \Rightarrow f(0) = 0$$

### Step 2: Assume polynomial form
Since the equation involves $2xy$, try a quadratic function. Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.

### Step 3: Substitute into the equation
Left side: $f(x+y) = a(x+y)^2 + b(x+y) + c$
Right side: $f(x) + f(y) + 2xy = (ax^2 + bx + c) + (ay^2 + by + c) + 2xy$

### Step 4: Compare coefficients
Equating both sides:
$$a(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + b(x + y) + c = a(x^2 + y^2) + b(x + y) + 2c + 2xy$$

This gives:
$$2axy + c = 2xy + 2c$$

So: $2a = 2$ and $c = 2c$, thus $a = 1$ and $c = 0$.

### Step 5: Final solution
$f(x) = x^2 + bx$ for any real $b$. However, check if this satisfies the original equation:

$$f(x+y) = (x+y)^2 + b(x+y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + bx + by$$
$$f(x) + f(y) + 2xy = (x^2 + bx) + (y^2 + by) + 2xy = x^2 + y^2 + bx + by + 2xy$$

These are equal, so $f(x) = x^2 + bx$ works for any $b$.

### Step 6: Check if there are other solutions
One can show that these are the only solutions using standard functional equation techniques.

## Final Answer
The functions are $f(x) = x^2 + bx$ for any real constant $b$.
